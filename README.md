# RecipeSearchEngine
A webscraper using Selenium checks a website's recipe catalogue. Downloads various elements of each recipe to be displayed in a graphical user interface.


As part of NOD bootcamp, I created a webscraper that checks a specific website's collection of recipes. 
A list of ingredients, instructions and category-tags are downloaded into three separate CSV-files per recipe. 
A graphic user interface guides the user to choose a specific recipe based on ingredients, or time to cook, or total caloric value. 
The ingredients and cooking instructions of the chosen recipe are displayed in a TKInter window.
